# The Binomial Method for Options Pricing

## Overview
Options are **financial contracts** that give buyers the "option" to buy or sell (long or short) an underlying asset (stock) for a **specified price at a certain time in the future**.  

Options derive their price from the underlying asset, but it's not that simple. There are several ways to price options, each way incorporating different parameters.  

This project explores the ***Binomial Method using the risk-neutal formula***, and will also demonstrate ***how the Binomial Method price converges to Black-Scholes*** as the number of steps in fixed physical time goes grows towards ∞.
